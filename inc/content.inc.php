			Fins have been essentially the same for decades. Drive Foil takes surfboard fins to a revolutionary new level using aerodynamic technology to create a foil which both carves and uses the natural flow of the wave to grip and propel your board.  These fins are made with stronger material to avoid dings as well as created with an environmentally friendly process which reduces harmful toxins and waste.

			All Drive Foil fins are made in the USA, from conception to shipping. Currently the fins are in a prototyping / testing phase, but contact us to be put in the loop or to place pre-orders.
