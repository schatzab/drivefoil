			Fins have been essentially the same for decades. Drive Foil takes surfboard fins to a revolutionary new level using aerodynamic technology to create a foil which both carves and uses the natural flow of the wave to grip and propel your board.  These fins are made with stronger material to avoid dings as well as created with an environmentally friendly process which reduces harmful toxins and waste. 
			<br><br>

			All Drive Foil fins are made in the USA, from conception to shipping. Currently the fins are in a prototyping / testing phase, but contact us to be put in the loop or to place pre-orders.

			One of the driving forces behind a Drive Foil fin is the fact that our fins are better for the environment.  The old process of creating resin blocks and shaving away excess material to form a fin produces more waste than is needed.  A Drive Foil fin is developed in an efficient build.  Once our fin is in your hands its durability will make your fin last longer, as well as make recycling and sharing a definite possibility.  
			<br><br>

			Our building process helps eliminate harmful chemicals from the environment and creates safer production for manufacturers.
